1. Sorry that most of the important part of the code is korean. Some was because openAPI only supports korean, and the others was for convinience.

2. This script generates two kinds of excel files. One is label with numbers (1_, 2_, ...) and the other is not. 
   One with a number label is a file you need. If you only want output, we just need to check them only. 
   The other ones are for data storage. I suggest you to download and store data there and read it from that file afterward. Code will be much faster

3. I'm still currently working on this code and my final result is to publish a website and add more features to this script. 
   Please let me now if there's any bug or some issue.
